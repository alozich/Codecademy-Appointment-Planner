# Appointment Planner

This project is a solution to the Codecademy "Appointment Planner" project, designed to help learners practice and understand React fundamentals.

## Overview

The Appointment Planner is a simple React application that allows users to add and view contacts and appointments. It demonstrates the use of React components, state management, props, and form handling.

## What I Learned

- **React Components:** Built reusable components for contacts and appointments.
- **State Management:** Used React's `useState` hook to manage application data.
- **Props:** Passed data and functions between components using props.
- **Form Handling:** Implemented controlled components for form inputs.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displayed content dynamically based on application state.
- **Project Structure:** Organized files and components in a scalable way.
